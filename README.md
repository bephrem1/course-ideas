Course Ideas Project Practicing Spring Framework (TeamTreehouse Project)

Instructor/Code: Craig Dennis

Explanation: A simple program utilizing the Spring Java library to create an interactive web application

Comments: Great lesson in http and really showed me to have a deep understanding of get and post requests
and how http works can really help (and is fundamental to) writing a web application. I have a project in
mind that I am going to pursue soon and the skills I am continuing to learn so far are going to be crucial
to its success. Spring is a robust micro-framework and I'm eager to build more projects on it soon!
